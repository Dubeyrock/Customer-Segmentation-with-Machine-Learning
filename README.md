# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

## Objective
The objective of this project is to implement customer segmentation using machine learning, specifically using the K-means clustering algorithm. The goal is to divide a supermarket's customer base into distinct groups based on their characteristics such as age, annual income, and spending score. This segmentation helps businesses target their marketing strategies and improve customer retention by offering personalized deals and improving customer service.

## Problem Statement
Customer segmentation is a marketing strategy where customers are grouped based on similar attributes, such as demographics, buying behavior, and spending patterns. This allows businesses to understand customer needs better and target specific segments with customized offers, thereby improving overall customer satisfaction and increasing business profits.

In this project, we are tackling the challenge of performing customer segmentation automatically using machine learning algorithms, replacing manual and time-consuming processes with a scalable, data-driven approach. We will use the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score.

## Approach
We will use K-means clustering to perform unsupervised machine learning, dividing the dataset into clusters that show similar patterns in the customers' behavior and demographic information. The steps involved in the approach are as follows:
1. **Data Collection**: We'll use a dataset containing customer details such as ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and explore the dataset, removing any unnecessary columns and filling in missing data.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the data using histograms, scatter plots, and violin plots to understand distributions and relationships between different variables.
4. **Clustering**: Apply the K-means algorithm to group customers into clusters based on the features: age, annual income, and spending score.
5. **Evaluation**: Analyze the clusters formed and validate the results using silhouette scores or other metrics.
